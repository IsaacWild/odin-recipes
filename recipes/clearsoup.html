    <h2>A clean, clear soup that will clense your heart and soul</h2>
    <p>This cyrstal clear soup is so wonderful to make after a sip you'll want to wonder how this recipie didn't make it to you sooner than it has! We'll need a few key special ingredients and we do reccomend to not substitue anything as it will effect the clarity and end flavour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Moon water (We suggest making your own on your next full Moon</li>
        <li>A couple of your birthstones</li>
        <li>Morning dew collected at sunrise</li>
        <li>Good Vibes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>After collecting your Moon water add half into a seperate bowl</li>
        <li>Add your birthstones into one of the containers</li>
        <li>Add a few drops of moring dew into the remaining Moon water</li>
        <li>Spend 10-20 min self meditating and reflect on your journey</li>
        <li>Strain the birthstones out of the now seasoned water</li>
        <li>Further stain out any impurites through a cheese cloth</li>
        <li>Then stain through active carbon and distil and condense the water</li>
        <li>Add into the bowl and serve with a few drops of the morning dew Moon water you still have</li>
        <li>If the spice is too much to handle you can always add more morning dew Moon water as needed</li>
    </ol>
